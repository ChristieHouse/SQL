# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

# How many distinct artists are represented by the top 50 Spotify songs of 2021?
SELECT count(distinct artist_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

# What artists have more than 1 song in the top 50 Spotify songs of 2021, and how many songs does each artist have on the list?
SELECT distinct artist_name, COUNT(track_name) AS number_songs
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING number_songs>1
ORDER BY number_songs desc, artist_name;

# What is the average danceability of the top 10 most popular Spotify songs of 2021?
SELECT AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE track_name IN 
    (SELECT track_name
    FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    ORDER BY popularity desc
    LIMIT 10);

# What artist has the longest song represented in the top 50 Spotify songs of 2021?
SELECT artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE duration_ms IN
    (SELECT MAX(duration_ms) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata);
